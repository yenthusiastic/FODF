                    <h1>Documentation Week 2 - 2D Design and 3D Design</h1>
                    <h3>Date: 18.10.2017 - 24.10.2017</h3>
                      <p>In this week we learn about designing 2D objects using the software <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/free-download/">Draftsight</a> and modelling 3D objects using the software <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/fusion-360-for-educational-institutions"> Fusion 360</a> from Autodesk.</p>
                    <a name="sect1"><h2>1. 2D Design in Draftsight</h2></a>
                      <p>While looking around for inspiration for my 2D Design, I found this cool <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/mechanical-iris-1/">Mechanical Iris</a> project on Instructable and decided to give it a try. The website also provided the DXF file for the design, thus I started with downloading the file and make some  measurements that I find important to "replicate" the design.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/1.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/2.png" height="75%" width="75%">            
                      <p>For some reason, the downloaded DXF file is not to the correct scale, as seen from the screenshots above that the design is too small (all measurements are in millimeters). However, this should not be a problem as long as I keep the ratio between the dimensions roughly the same in my design.</p>
                      <p>First I turn on the grid by typing in the command window <a id="keyword">GRID</a> and then <a id="keyword">ON</a>. Then I start with the simpler part of the design out of the 2. Using the command <a id="keyword">CIRCLE,</a> I specify a point on the grid to be the center of the circle and enter a <a id="keyword">diameter of 92.5mm.</a></p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/3.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>I continue to draw the inner circle using the same command and turn on the <a id="keyword">E-Snap</a> to pick the same center point as the previous circle, and enter a diameter of 32.5mm.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/4.png" height="75%" width="75%">  
                      <p>Next, I use the Polygon tool to draw a pentagon by specifying the number of sides to 5, picking the same center point as before, typing in <a id="keyword">COrner</a> for the option and drag the mouse such that each side of the pentagon just touches the circle.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/5.png" height="75%" width="75%">  
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/6.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>Again I use the <a id="keyword">CIRCLE</a> command to draw a circle of diameter 3mm whose center lies on one of the vertices of the pentagon. I use 3mm circle because later on I will use 3M screws through the holes.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/7.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>In order to copy the circle to the remaining vertices of the pentagon, I use the <a id="keyword">PATTERN</a> command. In the pop-up menu, I select the circle as the specified entity, set the <a id="keyword">Base Pattern on</a> properties to <a id="keyword">Fill Angle and Total number of Elements</a> so that I can type in the <a id="keyword">Fill angle = 360Â°</a> and <a id="keyword">Total number = 5.</a> Then I select the center point to be the center of the pentagon. By cliking OK, 4 more circles should appear on the other 4 vertices of the pentagon.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/9.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>Then I draw a line from the top of the circle of size 3.75mm to act as an offset distance for the next sketch.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/10.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>Using again the <a id="keyword">POLYGON</a> command with the same options as before, I draw a new concentric pentagon with one of its vertex meeting the end point of the offset line.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/11.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>Now that I have finished with the first part of the design, I make a copy of it to use as a guide for the remaining part. Also, I delete the unnecessary elements from the finished part such as the offset distance line and the inner pentagon which was only used to help draw the screw holes.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/13.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>On the second part of the design now I draw a new circle with the same center and with a radius such that the circle  just touches the screw holes.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/14.png" height="75%" width="75%"> 
                      <p>Next I re-check the original design and notice that I have to rotate the inner pentagon, so I use the <a id="keyword">ROTATE</a> command, choose center of the pentagon as the pivot and use the mouse to drag the pentagon to rotate in a small angle.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/16.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Then I draw 5 lines going from the center to the vertices of the pentagon and delete the pentagon because it was only used for reference purpose.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/19.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/20.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Next, I use the <a id="keyword">SPLINE</a> tool to draw one "petal" for the Iris using one of the 5 "slices" of the pentagon as a guide.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/22.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>After having 1 petal, I again type in the <a id="keyword">PATTERN</a> command to repeat it by 5 times around the center.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/23.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/24.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Using the <a id="keyword">CIRCLE</a> command, I draw a new concentric circle with radius of 39mm; and 5 more screw holes inside the "petals". There is no need for the exact position of these new screw holes, as long as they are opposite and roughly in line with the existing screw holes.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/25.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Using the <a id="keyword">ARC</a> command, I draw a small arc above one of the outer screw holes</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/26.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Then I use the <a id="keyword">OFFSET</a> command to duplicate the arc with a distance of 4mm below the original one.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/27.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Next I use the <a id="keyword">Eliptical Arc</a> tool to draw one of the rounded closing ends for the mechanical slot. The radius of the elipse is 2.5mm.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/28.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/29.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/30.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>I repeat this step for the other end to finish the mechanical slot</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/31.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Again, I use the <a id="keyword">PATTERN</a> command to duplicate it by 5 times around the center.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/32.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Now I draw a circle of radius 6mm under the slot and use the <a id="keyword">TRIM</a> tool to remove the unwanted line segments.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/34.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/35.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/36.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Then I repeat the arc again 5 times around the center and trim the unwanted segments for the remaining 4 arcs.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/37.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/38.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>I need to draw 5 more screw holes in the middle of these newly created arcs using the <a id="keyword">CIRCLE</a> and <a id="keyword">PATTERN</a> command.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/39.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Next I have to create a crank that acts as the connection between the outer frame and the "petal", like in this capture:</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/Capture.JPG" height="65%" width="65%">
                      <p>To do this, I copy one of the existing mechanical slots, rotate and scale it down using <a id="keyword">RORATE</a> and <a id="keyword">SCALE</a> command so that it fits in between the 2 screw holes.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/40.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Having the desired sketch of the crank, I copy it and the screw holes and duplicate them 5 times.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/41.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>Finally, I use the <a id="keyword">RECTANGLE</a> and <a id="keyword">CIRCLE</a> tool, as well as the <a id="keyword">TRIM</a> command to draw the handle for the outer frame.</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/42.png" height="75%" width="75%">
                      <p>With that, my design is finished.</p>
                    <a name="sect2"><h2>2. 3D Design in Fusion 360</h2></a>
                      <p>Since Halloween is coming soon, I think of making something fun for the holiday. So I looked around Youtube and found this very detailed toturial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csaliZ81daU&t=644s">How to model a Jack-O-Lantern</a> and decided to follow it. Although I worked with Fusion 360 in the <a id="keyword">MODEL</a>  Environment before, I have never tried working in the <a id="keyword">SCULPT </a> Environment so I find this tutorial very useful to learn new skills but also quite challenging.</p>
                      <p>Enough said, let's get started with modelling the Halloween pumpkin.</p>
                      <a name="sect2.1"><h3>2.1. Sketch the outline</h3></a>
                          <p>First I create a sketch for the outer shape of the pumpkin. I use the <a id="keyword">Spline</a> tool under the <a id="keyword">SKETCH</a> menu and choose the XZ working plane.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/0.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>I do not have to draw the full outer shape but only half of it because I would like it to be symmetrical about the vertical axis.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/1.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                      <a name="sect2.2"><h3>2.2. Create a form with revolve</h3></a>
                          <p>Next, I have to create a form for the pumpkin out of this outline by going to <a id="keyword">CREATE</a> menu and select <a id="keyword">Create Form</a>. At this point the software warns me that I am now going to the <a id="keyword">SCULPT</a> environment.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/2.png" height="60%" width="60%">
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/2a.JPG" height="30%" width="30%">
                          <p>When I am already in the <a id="keyword">SCULPT</a> environment, I would like to revolve the curve that I sketched just now in order to make a 3D form from it. For this we go to the <a id="keyword">CREATE</a> menu and then select <a id="keyword">Revolve</a>.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/3.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>Now the software shows me a menu with the parameters for Revolve. For the <a id="keyword">Profile</a> I choose the curve that I sketched, for the <a id="keyword">Axis</a> I choose the <a id="keyword">vertical axis</a> of the sketch's plane, the <a id="keyword">Spacing</a> should be <a id="keyword">Curvature</a>, the <a id="keyword">Symmetry</a> type should be <a id="keyword">Circular</a>, and the number of faces can be freely chosen depending on how many cloves of the pumpkin we want. For my design the parameters are chosen as below:</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/4.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>We can see that even before we press the OK button, we already have a preview of how the object will look like at the end of the Revolve process. When I press the OK button to confirm, I have a rough form of the pumpkin like this, with 10 equal faces on the surface of the pumpkin:</p> 
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/5.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>Also notice that now if I select one of the line segments of the pumpkin's surface, all the segments symmetrical to it are also selected (highlighted in <a style="color: yellow"><b>yellow</b></a>). This is because <a id="keyword">Symmetry constraint</a> have been automatically turned on at the end of the Revolve process. For now I need this symmetry constraint so I will keep it, and I will clear it later.</p>
                      <a name="sect2.3"><h3>2.3. Shaping the pumpkin</h3></a>
                          <p>Now I need to select all of the curve segments on the pumpkin's surface (these are called <a id="keyword">T-Splines</a> in Fusion 360) that I need to make a crease inwards, so that it actually looks more like a pumpkin. To do this, I have to <a id="keyword">click once</a> on one of the curve segments at the top, then <a id="keyword">hold SHIFT</a> and <a id="keyword">click twice</a> on the curve segment at the bottom that lie on the same curving egde. Holding SHIFT and clicking twice means that all curve segments in between the 2 selected segments will also be selected.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/5a.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>Now that all of the T-Splines are selected, I press right click to bring up the Options menu, then select <a id="keyword">Edit Form</a>. I also change the perpestive to the FRONT plane in order to have better view of what I am doing next.</p>
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/5b.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/6.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                          <p>Now comes the fun part: <a id="keyword">FORMING THE PUMPKIN.</a> In the parameters menu I have to first select <a id="keyword">Local</a> as the <a id="keyword">Coordinate Space</a>. This will change the coordinate system and the origin point from the global space (World Space) to the local space of the selected objects. Notice the difference in the coordinate system between the capture above and below:</p>

                    <h3>3.1. Problem with the 2D design</h3>
                      <p>The problem I encountered with my 2D design assignment was that sometimes the lines and curves do not intersect each other as expected, for example in this case it was like following:</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/2D Design/e1.png" height="80%" width="80%">
                      <p>Although this arc was not drawn from sketch but simply was duplicated using the <a id="keyword">PATTERN</a> command, somehow it still did not join with the circle. As a result, I could not <a id="keyword">TRIM</a> off unwanted line segments. Only when I zoomed in to fill the gap by extending the arc did the trimming work.</p>
                    <h3>3.2. Problem with the 3D design</h3>
                      <p>The 3D model of the Jack-O-Lantern looks simple but actually if we do not know some tips and tricks in the design process it could give some real headaches. From this tutorial, I learned that <a id="keyword">the flow of the design process has to be in a certain order</a> so that the software can properly model what we intend to do. For example, I have to do the splitting of the full pumpkin body, not only so that later on it is easier to be 3D printed, but also in order to easily shell the pumpkin in the next step. If I do the splitting step after the shelling step, the bottom and top part of the pumpkin will also be shelled off, which I do not want because it will make the 3D print structure unstable.</p>
                      
                      <p>Another problem I encountered also had to do with the <a href="#sect2.5">splitting and shelling</a> of the pumpkin. At the step of splitting the body with the offset plane, in the beginning I put in a too small value (in this case 1.2mm) for the offset and thus when the body is split, the 2 new bodies are not perfectly solid:</p>

                      <p>As a result, when I tried to shell the middle part of the pumpkin body, the software gave me an error:</p>
                      <img src="../media/week2/3D Design/errors/e5.png" height="65%" width="65%">
                      <p>Thus I had to edit my offset plane and bring it more upwards so that the bottom and the rest of the pumpkin are splitted in a solid way, like what we see in the end:</p>
